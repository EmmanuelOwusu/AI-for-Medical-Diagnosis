# AI-for-Medical-Diagnosis
This repository contains work done in AI for Medical Diagnosis in Coursera.

The Goal of this project is to learn:

* What is in an MR image

* Standard data preparation techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets

* Metrics and loss functions for segmentation

* Visualizing and evaluating segmentation models

[1. Assignment One](#1)

Chest X-Ray Medical Diagnosis with Deep Learning

In completing this assignment you will learn about the following topics: 

- Data preparation
  - Visualizing data
  - Preventing data leakage
- Model Development
  - Addressing class imbalance
  - Leveraging pre-trained models using transfer learning
- Evaluation
  - AUC and ROC curves
  
  
 [2. Import Packages and Function](#2)
 
 We'll make use of the following packages:
- `numpy` and `pandas` is what we'll use to manipulate our data
- `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` will be used to produce plots for visualization
- `util` will provide the locally defined utility functions that have been provided for this assignment

We  used several modules from the `keras` framework for building deep learning models in this project.
