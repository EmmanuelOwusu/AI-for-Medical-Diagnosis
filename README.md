# AI-for-Medical-Diagnosis
This repository contains a Project done in AI for Medical Diagnosis in Coursera.

[1. Week One](#1)


The goal of this Project is to learn:

* What is a MR image

* Standard data preparation techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Datasets

* Metrics and loss functions for segmentation

* Visualizing and evaluating segmentation models

[1.a. Assignment One](#1a)

This Assignment is on Chest X-Ray Medical Diagnosis with Deep Learning

 The following topics can be learnt from this Assignment: 

- Data preparation
  - Visualizing data
  - Preventing data leakage
- Model Development
  - Addressing class imbalance
  - Leveraging pre-trained models using transfer learning
- Evaluation
  - AUC and ROC curves
  
  
 [1.b. Import Packages and Function](#1b)
 
 We'll make use of the following packages:
- `numpy` and `pandas` is what we'll use to manipulate our data
- `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` will be used to produce plots for visualization
- `util` will provide the locally defined utility functions that have been provided for this assignment

Several modules from the `keras` framework were used  for building deep learning models in this project.
 
[2. Week Two](#2)

 * Evaluation of Diagnostic 


[3. Week Three](#3)
  * Brain Tumor Auto-Segmentation for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
