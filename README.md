## AI-for-Medical-Diagnosis

This Repository contains a Project done on AI for Medical Diagnosis in Coursera (AI for Medicine Specialization) .

[1. Week One](#1)

 [ Chest X-Ray Medical Diagnosis with Deep Learning](#A)


The Goal of this Project is to learn:

* What is a MR ( Magnetic Resonance)  Image

* Standard data preparation techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Datasets

* Metrics and Loss functions for Segmentation

* Visualizing and Evaluating Segmentation models

[1.a. Assignment One](#1a)

This Assignment is on Chest X-Ray Medical Diagnosis with Deep Learning 

 The following topics can be learnt from this Assignment: 

- Data preparation
  - Visualizing Data
  - Preventing Data Leakage
- Model Development
  - Addressing class imbalance
  - Leveraging pre-trained models using Transfer Learning
- Evaluation
  - AUC and ROC Curves
  
  
 [1.b. Import Packages and Function](#1b)
 
 We  make use of the following packages:
 
- `numpy` and `pandas` is what we use to manipulate our Data
- `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` are use to produce plots for visualization
- `util`  provide the locally defined utility functions that have been provided for this Assignment

Several modules from the `keras` framework were used  for building Deep Learning models in this Project.
 
[2. Week Two](#2)


 [Evaluation of Diagnostic Models](#B)
 
 * The following can be learnt from the   Assignment:
 
   * Accuracy
   
   * Prevalence
   
   * Specificity & Sensitivity
   
   * PPV (Positive Predictive Value) and NPV
   
   * ROC curve and AUCROC (C-Statistic)
   
   * Confidence Intervals

[3. Week Three](#3)
