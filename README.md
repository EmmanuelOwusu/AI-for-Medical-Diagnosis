## AI-for-Medical-Diagnosis

This Repository contains a Project done in AI for Medical Diagnosis in Coursera (AI for Medicine Specialization) .

[1. Week One](#1)

 [ Chest X-Ray Medical Diagnosis with Deep Learning](#A)


The goal of this Project is to learn:

* What is a MR ( Magnetic Resonance)  image

* Standard data preparation techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Datasets

* Metrics and loss functions for segmentation

* Visualizing and evaluating segmentation models

[1.a. Assignment One](#1a)

This Assignment is on Chest X-Ray Medical Diagnosis with Deep Learning 

 The following topics can be learnt from this Assignment: 

- Data preparation
  - Visualizing data
  - Preventing data leakage
- Model Development
  - Addressing class imbalance
  - Leveraging pre-trained models using transfer learning
- Evaluation
  - AUC and ROC Curves
  
  
 [1.b. Import Packages and Function](#1b)
 
 We will make use of the following packages:
 
- `numpy` and `pandas` is what we'll use to manipulate our data
- `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` will be used to produce plots for visualization
- `util` will provide the locally defined utility functions that have been provided for this Assignment

Several modules from the `keras` framework were used  for building deep learning models in this project.
 
[2. Week Two](#2)


 [Evaluation of Diagnostic Models](#B)
 
 * This assignment teaches us:
 
   * Accuracy
   
   * Prevalence
   
   * Specificity & Sensitivity
   
   * PPV and NPV
   
   * ROC curve and AUCROC (c-statistic)
   
   * Confidence Intervals

[3. Week Three](#3)
